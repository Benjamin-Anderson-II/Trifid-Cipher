# Trifid-Cipher

This is a program written in java to encrypt / decrypt a message using the triphid cipher.

The trifid cipher works as follows:

Each letter is assigned a 3 number value based on a the key

this value is then written vertically for each letter in to a grid, then afterward you would write it out horizontally, splitting every three letters and re-inserted back through the key, a quick example of this can be found in Key.java at the bottom

p.s. (Try decrypting my username)
